### Pay By Phone Assessment Solution
This is the assessment for Pay By Phone Front end Application The goal was to create a simple micro frontend
structure that pulls recipes from a json file and upon selection will populate the ingredients in alphabetical order.

### Setup
This uses React framework setup using Node Package manager (NPM) 8.3.1, React 18.2.0.
For the purposes of size, I removed the node_module directory so an NPM install is required
on step 4

1. Install NPM (at least v8.3.1)
2. download and unzip into a directory
3. go to the directory that this solution was unzipped too and go into \frontent-test\pbp-interview
4. run npm install to install the necessary packages
5. once completed run npm start to start the application 
6. (Optional) run npm test to run unit test, due to time constraints not many have been created.
